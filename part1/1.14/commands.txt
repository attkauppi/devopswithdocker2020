When building the container, I received loads of error messages and the build wouldn't even finish. The main error message was:

"rails aborted!
ArgumentError: Missing `secret_key_base` for 'production' environment, set this string with `rails credentials:edit`"

Presumably this is some sort of a salt that needs to be set for the server to run. Therefore, I added this line in my Dockerfile to assign some value for the secret_key_base argument:

ENV SECRET_KEY_BASE=tositosisalainen

Run:

$ docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 rails
